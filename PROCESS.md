# ARIA, etc. for Universal Design

[Using ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/)

This document is a practical guide for developers on how to add accessibility information to HTML elements using the Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification [], which defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

[ally.js](https://allyjs.io/)

ally.js is a JavaScript library simplifying certain accessibility features, functions and behaviors. However, simply loading ally.js will not automagically make a web application accessible. The library provides certain standard functions the "web platform" should've provided itself, so JavaScript applications can be made accessible more easily.
